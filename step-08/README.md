# AngularBeer - AngularJS tutorial - Step 08 #

In this step, you will implement the beer details view, which is displayed when a user clicks on a beer in the beer list.

When you click on a beer on the list, the beer details page with beer-specific information is displayed.

and we fleshed out the `beer-detail.html` view template.
