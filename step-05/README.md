# AngularBeer - AngularJS tutorial - Step 05 #

Enough of building an app with five beers in a hard-coded dataset! Let's fetch a larger dataset from our server using one of Angular's built-in services called `$http`. We will use Angular's dependency injection (DI) to provide the service to the `BeerListCtrl` controller.

## Data ##

Our new dataset is now a list of 11 beers stored in JSON format in the `app/beers/beers.json` file in your project.
This file is available from the server at the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/beers/beers.json

```json
[
  ...
  {
    "alcohol": 6.8,
    "description": "A reddish-brown abbey ale brewed with dark malts. The secondary fermentation gives a fruity aroma and a unique spicy character with a distinctive aftertaste. Secondary fermentation in the bottle.",
    "id": "AffligemDubbel",
    "img": "beers/img/AffligemDubbel.jpg",
    "name": "Affligem Dubbel"
  },
  ...
]
```
