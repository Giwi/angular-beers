# AngularBeer - AngularJS tutorial - Step 05 #

Enough of building an app with five beers in a hard-coded dataset! Let's fetch a larger dataset from our server using one of Angular's built-in services called `$http`. We will use Angular's dependency injection (DI) to provide the service to the `BeerListCtrl` controller.

There is now a list of 11 beers, available from the server at the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/beers/beers.json
