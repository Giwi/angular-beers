# AngularBeers - AngularJS tutorial #

We have built this [AngularBeers](https://github.com/LostInBrittany/angular-beers) tutorial as an alternative to the excellent [official AngularJS tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/).

We teach web-development in an Engineering School with a rather restrictive network. In order to explain AngularJS to our students, we needed a tutorial that could be played without network acces, i.e. without Bower or Grunt. 

So we decided to build an alternative version of the tutorial that could be done even behind a very restrictive proxy. And then we thought about the subject, what would our tutorial speak about? The official one was about Android phones, and it's great, but we wanted to make us more personal... so we chose doing it about beer.

## What do I need to use this tutorial ##

Besides a web browser and a text-editor (we suggest the excellent [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)), you will only need a web-server to test your code.

## Step 01 ##

This is the initial step of the tutorial. In this step you won't need to code, everything is already coded for you.

To see the app running in a browser, open a separate terminal/command line tab or window, go to the project directory and then run `node ./scripts/web-server.js` to start the web server. Now, open a browser window for the app and navigate to http://localhost:8000/app/ to see the current state of the app.
